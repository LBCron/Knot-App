//! The compact agent row: what a sidebar row shows once it is too narrow for
//! the full one.
//!
//! Contract: `openspec/specs/agent-list-ui/spec.md` - "A narrow sidebar shows
//! a compact layout". Ported from `AgentRowView.compactBody` in the Swift
//! reference.
//!
//! Only the row's *body* lives here. The row's frame - its id, selection
//! background, the dimming of a stopped agent, the companion indent, the
//! click handler and the context menu - stays in [`super::sidebar`] and is
//! identical either way, which is the point: two full row layouts would drift
//! apart the first time one of those changed.
